	Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is 
the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement,
 a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all 
the paragraphs relate to the thesis,</p>
<p title~=paragraph>
 whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences.
 In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>

	In academic writing, the topic sentence nearly always works best at the beginning of a paragraph so that the reader knows what to expect:</p>

	The embrace of Twitter by politicians and journalists has been one of its most notable features in recent years:
 for both groups the use of Twitter is becoming close to a requirement.</p>

—Paul Bernal, “A Defence of Responsible Tweeting”

<p>This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter.
 The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence.
 By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.</p>
